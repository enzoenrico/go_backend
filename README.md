# Project
Developed with the intent to learn more about low-level development, without abstractions commonly found in modern languages and frameweorks.
Learned how the 3-way handshake works, how to parse HTTP requests, and how to write a simple HTTP server in Go. Plans to implement authentication and caching in the future.
